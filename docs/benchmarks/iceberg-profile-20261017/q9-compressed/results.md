# Streaming Iceberg Nexmark observations

2,000,000 deterministic events; parallelism 4; four-bucket input/output tables. All times include streaming completion and final drain/commit.

| Query | State / mini-batch | Variant | Flink median [range], s | StreamFusion median [range], s | Median ratio |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| q9 | memory-on | exact | 3.312 [3.261–3.440] | 2.026 [1.772–2.079] | 1.63× |

## Exact-query aggregates

Geometric means use every exact-query cell in each mode; labelled expression variants remain separate above. Throughput is nominal corpus events divided by median end-to-end time, including startup, checkpoints and drain.

| State / mini-batch | Queries | Geomean ratio | Flink corpus events/s, range | StreamFusion corpus events/s, range |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| memory-on | 1 | 1.63× | 603,778–603,778 | 987,046–987,046 |

## Headline sampling convention

Memory uses the first measured sample; disk uses the best of the first two. The repeated medians and complete ranges above remain the primary results.

| Query | State / mini-batch | Variant | Flink, s | StreamFusion, s | Ratio |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| q9 | memory-on | exact | 3.440 | 2.079 | 1.65× |

Raw samples, warmups, parity checks, plans, committed table locations and native/fallback task/file witnesses are retained in this artifact directory. PROCTIME q12 validates per-bidder count conservation and includes waiting for the final processing-time window.
