# Coverage and fallbacks

What StreamFusion does **not** accelerate, and **every** condition that makes a query (or part of one)
fall back to stock Flink. The [Compatibility Chart](../readme.md#compatibility-chart) is the source of
truth for what *is* accelerated and under what terms; this is its complement — the boundaries.

> Keep this current. When an operator, type, expression, or connector gains or loses support, update

> my query accelerate?" precisely.

A query accelerates only if it forms **one fully-columnar island**: every operator but a rowwise
source/sink runs natively (Arrow in/out). One unsupported interior operator therefore drags the
**whole** query back to Flink (the all-or-nothing gate below). Use `NativePlanner.explain(...)` or
`-Dstreamfusion.logFallbackReasons=true` to see the recorded reason(s) for a given query.

**What counts as a fallback.** A fallback is something **Flink executes that we don't accelerate** —
a real gap we could close. It is *not* a fallback when Flink itself rejects the query in streaming
(e.g. `RANK`/`DENSE_RANK` Top-N, `LEAD`/non-time/`FOLLOWING` `OVER`, non-temporal `ORDER BY`): we match
Flink by also not running it, which is **parity**, not a gap. Nor is it a fallback when the feature
already accelerates via another plan shape (e.g. `UNION` distinct, which the host rewrites to a
`GROUP BY`). This file lists only real gaps; parity cases are called out as such where they'd otherwise
look like one.

## (a) What we don't support

### Whole operators with no native path
These have no matcher; any query containing one falls back entirely.

| Operator | SQL surface |
|---|---|
| `Correlate` | lateral table functions, and `UNNEST` with a pushed condition the expression engine can't encode (or any condition over a LEFT unnest). INNER **or LEFT** `UNNEST` of a single `ARRAY` (scalar or `ROW` element, flattened), `MAP` (key+value), or `MULTISET` (element by count) column — optionally `WITH ORDINALITY`, INNER including a pushed element filter — **is** supported (see the chart). |
| `TemporalJoin` | `FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF` versioned-table join |
| `LookupJoin` | dimension-table / async lookup join |
| `Match` | `MATCH_RECOGNIZE` (CEP / row-pattern) |
| `GroupWindowAggregate`, `GroupWindowTableAggregate` | legacy `GROUP BY TUMBLE(...)` windowing, and proctime group windows |
| `IncrementalGroupAggregate` | the three-phase (distinct) non-windowed `GROUP BY`. The ordinary two-phase / mini-batch `LocalGroupAggregate` + `GlobalGroupAggregate` (+ `MiniBatchAssigner`) **is** native — see the feature gaps and §2 below |
| `GroupTableAggregate` | `TableAggregateFunction` |
| `DropUpdateBefore`, `Values` | misc (a non-temporal `Sort` is parity — Flink rejects it in streaming) |
| `LegacyTableSourceScan`, `LegacySink` | legacy connectors |
| `Python*` (`PythonCalc`/`PythonCorrelate`/`PythonGroupAggregate`/`PythonOverAggregate`/…) | PyFlink UDFs |

### Feature gaps inside operators we *do* support
(Real gaps only — Flink runs these and we don't yet. Ordering a nested value, `MAX(array)`/`ORDER BY
array`, is **not** here: Flink rejects it too, so we're at parity.)
- **Aggregates** — non-windowed `GROUP BY` `SUM`/`MIN`/`MAX`/`COUNT` over `DECIMAL` **are** native
  (`SUM` → `DECIMAL(38, s)` with overflow → NULL; `MIN`/`MAX` → `DECIMAL(p, s)`; an i128 at scale `s`,
  matching Flink). Decimal `AVG`, two-phase decimal `SUM`, and window-aggregate decimal `SUM`/`AVG`
  still fall back. `AVG` is modeled only via the host's SUM/COUNT rewrite (not natively); two-phase
  `AVG`; window `AVG` only as a lone aggregate; value types outside
  bigint/double/int/smallint/tinyint/float/decimal (see `aggregate-type-support.md`).
- **Two-phase (mini-batch) `GROUP BY`** — all four operators run native: a native `MiniBatchAssigner`
  emits the proc-time marker, the local is a transient in-memory bundle flushed on that marker / a
  `mini-batch.size` trigger / before each checkpoint (no checkpointed state, like Flink's
  `MapBundleOperator`), the keyed shuffle is a native exchange, and the global reuses the single-phase
  group-aggregate operator (`COUNT` merges as a `SUM` over partial counts).
  Scope: SUM/MIN/MAX/COUNT over bigint/int/double, with **no widening of the partial** — `SUM(INT)`
  (whose partial Flink widens to bigint) routes single-phase, as does `AVG`/distinct (the latter plans
  as `IncrementalGroupAggregate`). Row-time mini-batch falls back.
- **`OVER`** — the unbounded `RANGE … CURRENT ROW` frame (running fold) **and** the bounded
  `ROWS BETWEEN n PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` frame (recomputed over the frame slice), over one
  ascending rowtime, all aggregates over one shared bigint/int/double value column. Real gaps:
  bounded-`RANGE` (time-interval) frame, independent value columns per aggregate, wider value types,
  and proctime ordering. (More than one window group, decimal bounded frames, `FOLLOWING` frames,
  non-time/descending order, and `LAG`/`LEAD` are parity — Flink rejects or single-groups them in
  streaming.)
- **Deduplication** — rowtime keep-first (`ORDER BY rowtime ASC`, insert-only) and keep-last (`DESC`,
  retracting) are both native; proctime deduplication falls back.
- **Joins** — proctime interval/window joins fall back; a residual non-equi predicate must be
  expressible by the native expression engine.
- **Sources/sink** — local `file:` path only (Parquet/ORC source, Parquet sink); Kafka decode limited
  (see below); CDC only Debezium/OGG JSON.
- **Proctime** variants of essentially every event-time operator (dedup, window agg, joins, `OVER`).

---

## (b) Every cause of fallback, by layer

### 1. Global / gate — these zero out the *entire* query
- **Master switch off**: `-Dstreamfusion.native.enabled=false`.
- **All-or-nothing island gate**: after substitution, if any operator other than a rowwise source
  (leaf) or the sink (root) is still row-wise, nothing is substituted — the whole query runs on Flink.
  So one unsupported interior operator drags the whole query back.
- **Insert-only guard**: every operator except the changelog-aware ones (`GROUP BY`, regular join,
  CDC source, `Calc`, `UNION ALL`, `Expand`, `ChangelogNormalize`, streaming Top-N / `LIMIT`) requires
  an insert-only input; a retracting/updating input falls it back.
- **Per-operator kill switch**: `-Dstreamfusion.operator.<name>.enabled=false` (e.g. `filter`,
  `groupAggregate`, `union`, `limit`, `expand`, `changelogNormalize`, `windowRank`,
  `localGroupAggregate`, `miniBatchAssigner`, …). The two-phase global half reuses the
  `groupAggregate` switch. `kafkaSource` defaults to *false*.

### 2. Per-operator matcher declines (exact conditions)
- **OVER** — a bounded-`RANGE` (time-interval) frame; a `ROWS` frame not of the form
  `n PRECEDING .. CURRENT ROW`; proctime ordering; aggregates not all over one shared
  bigint/int/double value column; `PARTITION BY` key outside
  bigint/int/string/boolean/date/timestamp/decimal. (More than one window group, decimal bounded
  frames, non-time/descending order, `FOLLOWING` frames, and `LAG`/`LEAD` never reach us — Flink
  rejects or single-groups them in streaming.)
- **Interval join** — not INNER/LEFT/RIGHT/FULL; no equi key; non-null-dropping (non-INNER) keys;
  equi-key type outside the supported set; non-equi residual not expressible; proctime bounds.
- **Window join** — same key/type/non-equi conditions; both sides must carry an event-time
  window-attached windowing.
- **Regular join** — unsupported join type; no equi key; non-null-dropping keys; non-equi residual not
  expressible; an input column type the converter can't carry.
- **Window aggregate / local / global** — window not event-time `TUMBLE`/`HOP`/`CUMULATE` (zero offset)
  over a local-time-zone rowtime; `HOP` slide / `CUMULATE` step doesn't divide size; key type outside
  bigint/int/string/boolean/date/timestamp/decimal; value type/aggregate mismatch; `AVG` (where noted);
  two-phase partials not single-field bigint/double.
- **GROUP BY (non-windowed)** — any aggregate other than SUM/MIN/MAX/COUNT (`AVG`, UDAF); a `DISTINCT`
  aggregate other than `COUNT(DISTINCT x)` (`SUM`/`MIN`/`MAX` `DISTINCT` fall back); idle-state TTL ≠ 0;
  an unsupported key/value column type. `SUM`/`MIN`/`MAX`/`COUNT` all admit `DECIMAL` (`SUM` →
  `DECIMAL(38, s)`, `MIN`/`MAX` → `DECIMAL(p, s)`); `COUNT(DISTINCT x)` keeps a per-key value set.
- **Local group aggregate** (two-phase local half) — any aggregate other than SUM/MIN/MAX/COUNT;
  a value type outside bigint/int/double; a partial Flink widens past the value type (e.g. `SUM(INT)`);
  an unsupported grouping-key/input column type.
- **Global group aggregate** (two-phase merge) — any merge other than SUM/MIN/MAX/COUNT; a partial
  column outside bigint/int/double; an unsupported grouping-key/output column type. (Both halves must
  match for the query to accelerate — one staying on the host drags the whole query back via the gate.)
- **Top-N** — a non-constant (variable) rank range; a row type the converter can't carry. (Insert-only
  and changelog input, an `OFFSET`, and a projected rank number are all handled. `RANK`/`DENSE_RANK`
  never reach us — Flink rejects them in streaming.)
- **LIMIT** — missing `FETCH`, or a retracting input (`OFFSET` is handled — it uses the retracting
  ranker over the insert-only input).
- **Deduplicate** — not a rowtime rank-1 (keep-first `ASC` or keep-last `DESC` are both native);
  proctime deduplication falls back.
- **Window Top-N / window dedup** — rank not starting at 1 (an `OFFSET`).
- **Windowing TVF** — not event-time `TUMBLE`/`HOP`/`CUMULATE` (zero offset) over a local-time-zone
  rowtime.
- **Event-time sort** — a secondary order key beyond the leading ascending rowtime. (A descending or
  non-time leading key is a non-temporal `Sort`, which Flink rejects in streaming — parity.)
- **Union** — a row type the converter can't carry. (`UNION` distinct is not a fallback — the host
  rewrites it to a `GROUP BY`, which routes through the aggregate path.)
- **Expand** — any project cell that isn't a column ref, a NULL literal, or the integer expand id.
- **ChangelogNormalize** — a pushed filter condition; the source-reuse variant; a row type the
  converter can't carry.
- **Watermark assigner** — only substituted when its input is already a columnar producer (otherwise
  left on host to avoid a double transpose — a no-op, not a true fallback).

### 3. Expression level — a `Calc`/filter falls back if *any* node is un-admitted
- **Unsupported function/operator** outside the admitted set (e.g. `MD5`; `CONCAT` for a NULL-semantics
  divergence; …).
- **CAST** — anything that isn't widening numeric (integer→wider int, integer→float/double,
  float→double); narrowing, float→int, and string casts fall back.
- **Incompatible functions** — off by default, native only under
  `-Dstreamfusion.expression.<NAME>.allowIncompatible=true` (or the blanket flag): `UPPER`, `LOWER`,
  `EXP`, `LN`, `SIN`, `COS`, `TAN`, `ASIN`, `ACOS`, `ATAN`, `LOG10`, and `ROUND` on float/double.
- **Literal/arity guards** — unsupported literal type; `SUBSTRING` non-literal or out-of-range
  start/length; `LEFT`/`RIGHT`/`REPEAT`/`LPAD`/`RPAD` non-literal or negative count; `TRIM` other than
  default BOTH-whitespace; `POSITION` with a FROM start; wrong arity for any admitted function.

### 4. Type level
- **Scalar leaf types.** Every column (and every nested leaf) must be a type the boundary converter
  carries: tinyint/smallint/int/bigint/float/double/boolean/char/varchar/timestamp/timestamp-ltz/date/decimal.
  Anything outside that — `TIME`, interval, raw/binary — falls back. Both gates
  (`FilterCalcMatcher.convertibleRow` for filter/`Calc`, `RowDataArrowConverter.supports` for the
  keyed/stateful operators) check this recursively.
- **Nested `ARRAY`/`MAP`/`ROW`/`MULTISET` are supported** (recursively, down to supported leaves; a
  `MULTISET<E>` rides the Arrow boundary as a `MAP<E, INT>`): carried through filters/projections,
  usable as a GROUP BY / join / dedup **key** (the nested value rides the row state as a DataFusion
  `ScalarValue` and is cast back to its declared column type on emit), and as a `COUNT` value column
  (counted for null-ness only). What still falls back for a nested column:
  - **Ordering a nested value** — `MAX`/`MIN` over it, `ORDER BY` it, or a Top-N/sort on it. Flink
    itself rejects `MAX(array)` and `ORDER BY array`, so this matches the host.
- **Key types** outside bigint/int/string/boolean/date/timestamp/decimal **(plus the nested types
  above)** for join/OVER/window/group keys.
- **Aggregate value types** outside the parity matrix in `aggregate-type-support.md`. Non-windowed
  `GROUP BY` `SUM`/`MIN`/`MAX`/`COUNT` now cover `DECIMAL`; decimal `AVG` and window-aggregate decimal
  `SUM`/`AVG` still fall back.

### 5. Source / sink / connector
- **Filesystem** — non-local path (`hdfs:`/`s3:`/…) for the Parquet/ORC source and Parquet sink; any
  non-Parquet/ORC source format; any non-Parquet sink format.
- **Kafka** — value format outside JSON/CSV/raw/bare-Avro/protobuf; `avro-confluent` (decoder exists,
  not wired); a `key.format`; a topic pattern; specific-offsets / unsupported bounded startup mode;
  protobuf fields needing representation reconciliation (enum/unsigned/bytes/proto3-defaults/well-known
  types).
- **CDC** — anything other than Debezium/OGG full-image JSON: Maxwell/Canal (partial-`old` not
  bit-identical), `schema-include` envelope, `ignore-parse-errors`, metadata/computed columns.
